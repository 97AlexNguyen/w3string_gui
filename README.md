Hi guys .I have enhanced some of these tools for personal use and now wish to share them with everyone. I hope they are useful to you.
Git : https://github.com/97AlexNguyen/The-Witcher-3-Mod-manager
**New Features:**
- A redesigned menu section.
- The ability to sort and group mods by category for better organization.
- Automatic category extraction from Nexus Mods, which assigns each mod to its appropriate group. Support both : API and web scrap.
- An added mod summary display that allows users to quickly see what each mod does.
**ToDo:**
- Support for installing additional files, such as .ini, .dll, and more.
- An improved menu installation system that creates automatic checkpoints for game menus before any mod overwrites them. This ensures that uninstalling a mod will restore the menu to its original state.

- An integrated companion tool for working with .w3strings files, featuring:
  - Encoding and decoding of .w3strings.
  - Splitting CSVs by ID and merging them back together.
  - A design specifically aimed at enabling mod translation via AI. Users can extract lines based on ID, send them to an AI like ChatGPT for translation, and then merge them back, making mod localization much more efficient.
