ðŸ§° What is this tool?
W3StringsGUI is a user-friendly graphical tool that helps modders and translators work with .w3strings files used in The Witcher 3. These files contain all in-game text for quests, UI, dialogs, etc.
Instead of using the command line to decode and encode them, this tool provides a streamlined, modern GUI with tabs for each task:

Decode .w3strings to readable CSV
Split CSV into structured text for translation
Re-merge translated files
Encode back to .w3strings with optional ID space and verbose settings
